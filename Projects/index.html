      <p>
        Design a program that integrates the mask detection program, body
        temperature, and antiseptic use so that it becomes a unified program as
        an implementation tool for health protocols to prevent the spread of the
        corona virus or Covid-19. The realization of a device to detect masks,
        body temperature and the use of antiseptics that can be implemented at
        the door of public facilities such as schools/campuses so that everyone
        before entering the room will be checked for body temperature and
        whether they have a mask or not.

        The mask detection system is used to detectsomeone who is wearing a mask
        and not wearing a mask to prevent the spread ofthe COVID-19 virus as the
        government has recommended, namely checking maskusers and body
        temperature regularly. This mask detection system uses a webcamcamera, a
        mask recognition program based on an artificial intelligence libraryand
        image processing, and an MLX90614 thermal sensor.

        Design of 4 Patch Antenna Linear Microstrip Antenna at Frequency 915 MHz
        Using CST Studio
      </h4>
      <p>
        To obtain a form of radiation that cannot be provided by a single
        antenna can be done by arranging a number of antenna elements
        systematically. This arrangement of antenna elements is called an array.
        In general, the elements of this stacking antenna are the same as each
        other. In other words, a stacking antenna is an arrangement of two or
        more antenna elements to obtain a certain form of radiation. The
        geometric configuration of stacking antennas is generally linear or
        planar. In a linear arrangement, the centers of the antenna elements
        form a straight line. These elements can be equidistant or different
        from each other.

        Transmission System and Parameter Analysis of Digital TV Transmitter at
        Transmission Unit LPP TVRI Joglo West Jakarta
      </h4>
      <p>
        LPP TVRI transmission station has a transmitter station located in
        Joglo, West Jakarta. The station has three transmitters each capable of
        serving analog, digital, and dualcast broadcasts used to broadcast its
        broadcasts. This transmitter has used the DVB-T2 digital system format
        in accordance with government regulations. In this system, broadcasts
        that have previously passed through the uplink system to the satellite
        will pass through the downlink system before finally being transmitted
        by the transmitter antenna. The captured signal will then go through a
        decoding and demodulation process using an IRD device. The output signal
        from this device is a broadcast information signal that is ready to be
        transmitted again. An analog transmitter device is also called an analog
        exciter.

        Comparison of Response Time of Artificial Intelligence Mask Detection
        Program Implemented on Several Computer and Microcontroller Platforms
      </h4>
      <p>
        The use of masks during the Covid-19 pandemic is crucial to prevent
        transmission of the Covid-19 virus. Everyone is required to wear a mask
        in public places both indoors and outdoors. Therefore, a mask detection
        device is urgently needed to allow visitors to enter public facilities
        and reduce interaction between officers and visitors. Currently, many
        algorithms and programs for detecting masked faces based on artificial
        intelligence have been proposed using cameras and image processing.
        However, unfortunately, the implementation, realization, and application
        in public places are still ineffective.
