      <p class="text-1xl mt-10 mr-14 text-left text-balance tracking-wider">
        Hey There! üëãüèª my name is Raihana Aqila. I am a Software Quality
        Assurance, I am a junior IT professional with a background in
        telecommunication engineering. Passionate about learning new
        technologies and exploring different areas, particularly in
        cybersecurity, software development, Internet of Things, Artificial
        Intelligence, Blockchain and recently specialized in software quality. I
        developed a strong interest in bug hunting, finding it intriguing and
        exciting.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-5">
        My approach to software development is pragmatic and
        developer-supportive, balancing team and product requirements. I find to
        contribute in ensuring the successful delivery of high-quality software
        and development process. By conducting thorough testing and finding any
        potential bugs or issues before the product is launched, I feel like I
        am an important part of ensuring that the end user will have a smooth
        and satisfying experience.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-5">
        In addition, I also enjoy the collaborative aspect of this job, working
        closely with the development team and other stakeholders to ensure that
        every aspect of the product is properly tested and verified before
        release. It's very satisfying when the product launches with little or
        no bugs, as I know that my hard work has contributed to the quality and
        success of the product.
      </p>
      <p class="description">
        And for now, I continue to learn to develop and hone my skills further
        towards fullstack development. I believe that a solid understanding of
        software development from testing to implementation will give me a more
        comprehensive view and allow me to more effectively collaborate with the
        development team and contribute greater added value in every stage of
        the software development lifecycle.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-3xl mt-5 font-semibold">Other hobbies</h3>
      <p class="mt-5">
        Life isn't solely about work or learning; like everyone else, I have
        hobbies that provide the fuel and necessary recharging to keep me
        motivated. Apart from my professional pursuits, I find joy in watching
        YouTube, playing games, taking care of pets, and indulging in comic
        reading. These activities offer me moments of relaxation and enjoyment
        outside of my daily responsibilities, allowing me to unwind and
        rejuvenate for the challenges ahead.
