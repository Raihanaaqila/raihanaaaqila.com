        <p class="mt-5">
          To obtain a form of radiation that cannot be provided by a single
          antenna can be done by arranging a number of antenna elements
          systematically. This arrangement of antenna elements is called an
          array. In general, the elements of this stacking antenna are the same
          as each other. In other words, a stacking antenna is an arrangement of
          two or more antenna elements to obtain a certain form of radiation.
          The geometric configuration of stacking antennas is generally linear
          or planar. In a linear arrangement, the centers of the antenna
          elements form a straight line. These elements can be equidistant or
          different from each other.

          Transmission System and Parameter Analysis of Digital TV Transmitter

        <p class="mt-5">
          LPP TVRI transmission station has a transmitter station located in
          Joglo, West Jakarta. The station has three transmitters each capable
          of serving analog, digital, and dualcast broadcasts used to broadcast
          its broadcasts. This transmitter has used the DVB-T2 digital system
          format in accordance with government regulations. In this system,
          broadcasts that have previously passed through the uplink system to
          the satellite will pass through the downlink system before finally
          being transmitted by the transmitter antenna. The captured signal will
          then go through a decoding and demodulation process using an IRD
          device. The output signal from this device is a broadcast information
          signal that is ready to be transmitted again. An analog transmitter
          device is also called an analog exciter.

          Comparison of Response Time of Artificial Intelligence Mask Detection
          Program Implemented on Several Computer and Microcontroller Platforms
        </h4>
        <p class="mt-5">
          The use of masks during the Covid-19 pandemic is crucial to prevent
          transmission of the Covid-19 virus. Everyone is required to wear a
          mask in public places both indoors and outdoors. Therefore, a mask
          detection device is urgently needed to allow visitors to enter public
          facilities and reduce interaction between officers and visitors.
          Currently, many algorithms and programs for detecting masked faces
          based on artificial intelligence have been proposed using cameras and
          image processing. However, unfortunately, the implementation,
          realization, and application in public places are still ineffective.
